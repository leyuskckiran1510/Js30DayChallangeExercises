Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide

Airbnb has one of the most popular JavaScript style guides on the internet.
It covers nearly every aspect of JavaScript as well and it is adopted by many
developer and companies. You may checkout the Airbnb style guide. I would also
recommend to try it. Their style is very easy to use and simple to understand.

/*
Standard JavaScript Style Guide

This is guideline is not as popular as Airbnb but it worth to look at it.
They removed the semicolon in their style guide.

/*
Conventions use in 30DaysOfJavaScript

In this challenge we follow the regular JavaScript convention but
I added also my preference of writing.

# We used camelCase for variables and functions.
# All variable names start with a letter.
# We .chose to use const for constants, arrays, objects and functions. 
		In stead of double quote, we chose to use single quote or backtick. Single quote is becoming trendy.
# We also removed semicolons from our code but it is a matter of personal preference.
# Space around arithmetic operators, assignment operators and after comma
# Arrow function instead of function declaration
# Explicit return instead of implicit return if the function is one liner
# No trailing comma in the last value of an object
# We prefer this +=, -=, *= /=, **= instead of the longer version
# When we use console.log() it is good to print with a tag string to
		 identify from where the console is coming
